# 📊 Analysis of Economic Policy Using Consumer Price Index (CPI)

## 📌 Overview
This project examines **economic trends** using the **Consumer Price Index (CPI-U)**, a critical metric for inflation tracking. By analyzing CPI changes across different categories, we assess **economic policies' effectiveness** in regulating inflation and consumer purchasing power.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: OECD & IMF CPI database (United States)
- **Time Frame**: October 2023 - January 2024
- **Entries**: 266 expenditure categories

## 🔍 Key Analyses
1. **CPI Trends & Inflationary Pressures**: Time series visualization of price changes.
2. **Class-Wise Distribution**: Breakdown of **Food, Energy, and Other** expenditure categories.
3. **Seasonal Adjustments & Outlier Analysis**: Identifying price spikes.
4. **Statistical Testing**: ANOVA, T-tests, and Chi-Square analysis to assess economic stability.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Regression models for forecasting inflation trends.

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Pie Charts**: Class-wise distribution of CPI items.
- **Bubble Charts**: Price change patterns in major categories.
- **Histograms & Density Plots**: Seasonal variations in price adjustments.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationship between expenditure importance & price change.

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Energy prices heavily influence overall inflation** due to their impact on **transportation & food costs**.
- **Food and Energy prices exhibit seasonal fluctuations**, requiring policy interventions.
- **Linear regression & SVM models** successfully predict CPI trends.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-learn** (Regression, SVM)
- **Statsmodels** (ANOVA, T-tests, Hypothesis testing)

## 🎯 Policy Recommendations
- Implement **fuel price regulations** to stabilize inflationary effects.
- Adjust tax policies on **food & transportation** to mitigate rising costs.
- Use **machine learning models** for more accurate inflation forecasting.
