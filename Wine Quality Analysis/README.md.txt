# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **physicochemical properties** influencing the quality of **Portuguese Vinho Verde wines**. Using **machine learning**, we classify and predict wine quality while applying **dimensionality reduction and feature selection** techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Wine Quality Dataset)
- **Samples**: 6,497 red & white wine samples
- **Features**: 11 physicochemical properties (e.g., pH, alcohol, acidity, sulphates)

## 🔍 Key Analyses
1. **Data Preprocessing & Class Balancing**: Handled class imbalances using **SMOTE**.
2. **Feature Selection**: Applied **LASSO regression** to determine key predictors.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Used **PCA** for visualization and pattern detection.
4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Predicting wine quality scores.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Classifying high vs. low-quality wines.
   - **Isolation Forest**: Detecting outliers in wine properties.

## 📈 Visualizations
- **PCA Plots**: Clustering of wine samples based on quality.
- **Feature Importance (LASSO Regression)**: Impact of alcohol, acidity, and sulphates.
- **Outlier Detection (Isolation Forest)**: Identifying anomalies in wine chemistry.

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Alcohol** is the strongest predictor of wine quality (+0.381 coefficient in LASSO regression).
- **Sulphates & residual sugar** also positively influence quality.
- **SMOTE improved classification performance**, boosting F1-score to 0.72.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, LASSO, PCA)
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** for handling class imbalance

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Experiment with **non-linear models** like **Random Forest & Neural Networks**.
- Use **more advanced feature engineering** to improve classification accuracy.
